</p>
<H1 style="text-align: center;font-size:30px ; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #00008B"> Project Description</H1>This project aims to identify the key indicators of customer churn for a telecommunications company and develop a model to predict which customers are likely to churn. The project will also provide insights into effective retention strategies that the company can implement to reduce customer churn. The data will be processed and analyzed using various techniques such as data cleaning, bivariate and multivariate analysis, and exploratory data analysis. The best-performing model will be selected and evaluated, and suggestions for model improvement will be provided. The ultimate goal of this project is to help the telecommunications company reduce customer churn and improve customer retention.
